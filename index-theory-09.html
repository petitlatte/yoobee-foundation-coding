									<h2>Aldous Huxley:</h2>
									 <p>"Democracy can hardly be expected to flourish in societies where political and economic power is being progressively concentrated and centralized. But the progress of technology has led and is still leading to just such a concentration and centralization of power."</p>

									<h1>Philosophy In Tech</h1>
									<h2>George Orwell</h2>
									<p>"It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away. A nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself â€“ anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide. In any case, to wear an improper expression on your face (to look incredulous when a victory was announced, for example) was itself a punishable offense. There was even a word for it in Newspeak: facecrime, it was called. (1.5.65)"</p>

									<h1>Philosophy In Tech</h1>
									<h2>Carl Jung</h2>
									<p>""In general it can be said that for modern man/woman technology is an imbalance that begets dissatisfaction with work or with life. It estranges man/woman from his/her natural versatility of action and thus allows many of his/her instincts to lie fallow.""</p>
